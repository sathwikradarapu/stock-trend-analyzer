History
Tata Sierra (1991-2000)
Tata Sumo (1994â€“2019)
Tata Motors was founded in 1945, as a locomotive manufacturer. Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany in which Tata developed a manufacturing facility in Jamshedpur for Daimler lorries.[10] By November 1954 Tata and Daimler manufactured their first goods carrier chassis at their Jamshedpur plant with 90-100 hp and capacity of 3-5 tons.[11] After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, 
Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a sport utility vehicle based on the Tata Mobile platform. Tata subsequently launched the Tata Estate (1992; a station wagon design based on the earlier Tata Mobile), the Tata Sumo (1994, a 5-door SUV) and the Tata Safari (1998).[citation needed]
Tata Indica (first generation)
Tata launched the Indica in 1998. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, later appeared. Tata Motors also exported cars to South Africa.[12]
In the 2000s, Tata Motors made a series of acquisitions and partnerships, acquiring Daewoo's South Korea-based truck manufacturing unit,[13] a joint venture with the Brazil-based Marcopolo, Tata Marcopolo Bus,[14] Jaguar Land Rover.,[15][16][17][18] Hispano Carrocera,[19] and an 80% stake in the Italian design and engineering company Trilix.[20]
On 12 October 2021, private equity firm TPG invested $1 billion in Tata Motors' electric vehicle subsidiary.[21]"""
